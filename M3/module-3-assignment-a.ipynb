    "\n",
    "The Hamming distance is the number of positions in between two strings of equal length. It is defined as the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different. In other words, it is the minimum number of substitutions required to change one string into the other. The Hamming distance is named after Richard Hamming, who introduced the concept in the context of error-correcting codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider two binary strings,\n",
    "`1100111001` and `0100010101`. The Hamming distance is 4, because at positions 1, 5, 7 and 8, we\n",
